pyepr.sequences.ReptimeScan
===========================

.. py:class:: pyepr.sequences.ReptimeScan(*, B, freq, reptime, reptime_max, averages, shots, start=20, dim=100, **kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`HahnEchoSequence`


   Represents a reptime scan of a Hahn Echo Sequence. 


   A Hahn echo sequence is perfomed with the shot repetition time increasing.1


   :Parameters:

       **B** : int or float
           The B0 field, in Guass

       **freq** : int or float
           The freq frequency in GHz

       **reptime: float**
           The default reptime, this is used for tuning pulses etc...

       **averages** : int
           The number of scans.

       **shots** : int
           The number of shots per point

       **reptime_max** : float
           The maximum shot repetition time in us

       **start** : float
           The minimum shot repetition time in us, by default 20 us

       **dim** : int
           The number of points in the reptime axis

   .. py:attribute:: name
      :value: 'ReptimeScan'



   .. py:method:: simulate()

      
      Simulates the reptime scan as an exponential recovery.

      .. math::
          V(t) = 1 - e^(-t/T1)




      :Returns:

          **t** : np.ndarray
              The x-axis of the simulation

          **data** : np.ndarray
              The y-axis of the simulation
