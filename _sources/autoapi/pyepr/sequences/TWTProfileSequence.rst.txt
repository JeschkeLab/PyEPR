pyepr.sequences.TWTProfileSequence
==================================

.. py:class:: pyepr.sequences.TWTProfileSequence(*, B, freq, reptime, averages=1, shots=100, dtp=2, **kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`Sequence`


   Builds TWT based Resonator Profile sequence. 


   Represents an experimental pulse sequence.


   :Parameters:

       **name** : str
           The name of this pulse sequence

       **B** : float
           The magnetic field for this sequence in Gauss.

       **freq** : float
           The central frequency of this sequence. I.e. The frequnecy at which
           a zero offset pulse is at. 

       **reptime** : float
           The shot repetition time in us.

       **averages** : int
           The number of scans to be accumulated.

       **shots** : itn
           The number of shots per point.

       **LO** : float
           The now deprecated local oscillator frequency. freq should be used.
