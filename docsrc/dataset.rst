Dataset Tutorial
================

PyEPR uses an advanced object-oriented dataset object. This has many advantages over the traditional numpy array.

1. **Axes**: The dataset object has named axes, which makes it easier to keep track of what each axis represents. This is especially useful when working with multidimensional data.
2. **MetaData**: The dataset object stores critical MetaData in the same object.
3. **Methods**: We are able to create EPR specific methods, allowing users to easily perform regular EPR tasks such as phase correction.
