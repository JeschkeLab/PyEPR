It is recommended that most users should use PyEPR inside a Jupyter notebook, unless PyEPR is being used as a backend for another program.

If you have never used Jupyter notebooks before, we recommend that you first familiarize yourself with the basics of Jupyter notebooks.
There are many tutorials available online, such as the one provided by the Jupyter project. <https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/>

To get started, we will first import the PyEPR package.

.. code-block:: python

    import pyepr as esr

This will import the PyEPR package, except for the hardware modules. Importing of hardware modules is included hardware-control tutorial.
